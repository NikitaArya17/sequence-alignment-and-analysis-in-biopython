# The Biopython Suite
* [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is a suite of software tools and Python packages designed for biological computation.
* The tools it provides have several applications in bioinformatics and computational biology.
* Biopython has libraries that can be used, among other things, for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, protein sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction.
* This repository will demonstrate these functions through a series of short projects.
